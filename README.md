### Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Titanic-and-Orders-Data
Titanic Dataset contains information related to passengers like Cabin, Ticket, Number,Survived. In this data columns like Cabin, Ticket, Number contains mix data of string and numeric data type. So using some basic data analysis techniques, i tried to separate this information in two respective columns like categorical and numerical. Then in another column Orders data, it contains information like date, product id, city id, orders. Date format is yyyy-mm-dd so i seperate each year, month & date in new column for easy interpretation
